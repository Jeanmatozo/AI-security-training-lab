# AI-security-training-lab
A professional AI security training lab for hands-on testing of LLM, RAG, and agent-based systems, with attack playbooks, evidence capture, and reporting workflows.

This lab focuses on real-world vulnerabilities found in:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- AI Agents and tool-enabled models

The project includes vulnerable AI applications, attack playbooks, testing tools, and evidence collection workflows aligned with the **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications** and emerging **AI security best practices**.

The goal is to provide a **repeatable environment for learning and practicing AI security testing**.

## Quickstart
The quickest way to begin is to clone the repository and run one of the lab environments.

## Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AI-security-training-lab.git
cd AI-security-training-lab
```
## Local Setup   
**1. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**2. Configure your environment**
Create a .env file based on the example template.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
**3. Add your OpenAI API Key**
Edit the .env file and add your API key.
Example:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4.1-mini
```
**4. Run a lesson or lab environment**
Example:
```bash
python environments/chatbot/app.py
```
  This will launch a vulnerable chatbot environment that can be used to practice prompt injection and system prompt extraction attacks.

## Docker Setup
The lab can also be run using Docker, which provides a consistent and isolated environment.

This is the recommended approach for security labs.

Start the lab environment
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will start all configured lab environments including:
- Vulnerable chatbot
- RAG pipeline
- AI agent
- Admin panel
- Stop the environment
